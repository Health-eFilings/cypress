title,description
"Adverse Event","Adverse Event is used to define any untoward medical occurrence associated with the clinical care delivery, whether or not considered drug related."
"Allergy/Intolerance","Allergy is used to address immune-mediated reactions to a substance such as type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, other allergy-like reactions, including pseudo-allergy. Intolerance is a record of a clinical assessment of a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have a non-immune mediated adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance or class of substance."
"Assessment","Assessment is a category used to define specific observations that clinicians use to guide treatment of the patient. An assessment can be a single question, or observable entity with an expected response, an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, clinicians, or other individuals, or a single observable entity that is part of a collection of questions."
"Care Experience","Care Experience represents the experience a patient has when receiving care or a provider has when providing care. The individual Care Experience datatypes should be consulted for further details."
"Care Goal","Care Goal represents a defined target or measure to be achieved in the process of patient care, that is, an expected outcome. A typical goal is expressed as a change in status expected at a defined future time. That change can be an observation represented by other QDM categories (diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, symptoms, etc.) scheduled for some time in the future and with a particular value. A goal can be found in the plan of care (care plan), the structure used by all stakeholders, including the patient, to define the management actions for the various conditions, problems, or issues identified for the target of the plan. This structure, through which the goals and care-planning actions and processes can be organized, planned, communicated, and checked for completion, is represented in the QDM categories as a Record Artifact. A time/date stamp is required. Specifically, a care plan is composed of the following elements: <ul><li>Problem, which is managed by other QDM standard categories (condition/diagnosis/problem) and their related data elements.</li> <li>Procedure, which is managed by other standard categories and their related data elements. <ul style=""list-style-type: '- ';""><li>Note that procedures are a continuum of interventions ranging from actions patients can do for themselves to those that can be performed by others (caregivers or clinical professionals), including detailed complex surgical procedures requiring highly trained physicians, nurses, and state-of-the-art facilities.</li></ul> </li> <li>Goal, which is what is expected to happen.</li> <li>Outcome, which is what happened. An outcome can be shown by other QDM standard categories and their related data elements.</li></ul>"
"Communication","Communication represents the transmission, receipt, or acknowledgement of information sent from a source to a recipient, such as from one clinician to another regarding findings, assessments, plans of care, consultative advice, instructions, and educational resources. The HL7 FHIR 3.0 resource Communication defines communication as a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The senders and receivers may be patients, practitioners, care partners, organizations, or devices. Established FHIR resources include: <ul><li>A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider</li><li> A recorded notification from the nurse that a patient's temperature exceeds a value</li><li>A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency</li><li>Patient educational material sent by a provider to a patient</li><li>Non-patient specific communication use cases may include:</li><ul style=""list-style-type: '- ';""><li>A nurse call from a hall bathroom</li><li>Advisory for battery service from a pump</li></ul></ul>Generally, direct patient counseling, training or education represents an intervention or procedure. A time and a date stamp are required.<br>QDM through version 5.3 included three communication QDM datatypes:<ul><li>""Communication, Provider to Patient""</li><li>""Communication, Patient to Provider""</li><li>""Communication, Provider to Provider""</li></ul>These three datatypes restricted the measure developer to communication between patients and providers and among providers. The structure of the datatypes also provided implicit guidance to implementers to define what type of provider based on the intent of the measure.<br>QDM 5.4 merged the three communication QDM datatypes into one, ""Communication, Performed"" to allow greater expressivity and more explicit definition of the sender and receiver and to indicate the anticipated communication medium. This new QDM modeling is more consistent with other QDM datatypes and it is also modeled more consistently with existing communication interoperability resources (e.g., HL7 FHIR). Note that measure developers need to test measures that use ""Communication, Performed"" to determine if the sender and recipient attribute information is available. Confirmation regarding receipt of communications requires interoperability."
"Condition/Diagnosis/Problem","<p>Condition/Diagnosis/Problem represents a practitioner's identification of a patient's disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient's plan of care (e.g., pregnancy).</p><p>The QDM does not prescribe the source of diagnosis data in the EHR. Diagnoses may be found in a patient's problem list, encounter diagnosis list, claims data, or other sources within the EHR. The preferred terminology for diagnoses is SNOMED CT, but diagnoses may also be encoded using ICD-9-CM and/or ICD-10-CM.</p><p>The Diagnosis datatype should not be used for differential diagnoses or rule-out diagnoses (neither of which are currently supported by the QDM).</p>"
"Device","<p>Device represents an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and not dependent on being metabolized to achieve any of its primary intended purposes.</p><p>Documented evidence of a device may exist in a clinical record in various ways:</p><ul><li>A provider may document placement of a device as an intervention or procedure (e.g., the QDM datatypes Intervention, Performed, or Procedure, Performed). Example: Procedure, Performed: Pacemaker insertion.</li><li>The provider may document presence of the device as a finding, perhaps including the finding on the problem list. Example: Diagnosis: Pacemaker present, or Assessment, Performed: Pacemaker present.</li><li>A provider may also document the device in a specific device use statement or assessment. <ul style=""list-style-type: '- ';""><li>Example: Device, Applied: Transtelephonic monitoring of pacemaker assessment. Note that the current use of the QDM datatype 'Device, Applied' usually references the procedure to 'apply' the device (i.e., to use for the patient, to use on the patient's body, or to implant in the patient's body). Each of these current uses should address the concept using the QDM datatypes, Intervention, Performed, or Procedure, Performed.</li></ul></li></ul> Given the variation in determining evidence of device usage, a measure developer may need to include multiple queries (or retrieves) to assure capture of all devices present in the measure population. The QDM datatype, Device, Applied, provides the best method to determine specific details about the device in use if a device usage assessment exists to provide such information. It also allows a measure developer to explicitly express which devices should be included in the query."
"Diagnostic Study","Diagnostic Study represents any kind of medical test performed as a specific test or series of steps to aid in diagnosing or detecting disease (e.g., to establish a diagnosis, measure the progress or recovery from disease, confirm that a person is free from disease). The QDM defines diagnostic studies as those that are not performed in organizations that perform testing on samples of human blood, tissue, or other substance from the body. Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports. Such studies include, but are not limited to, imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary function testing, and vascular laboratory testing."
"Encounter","Encounter represents an identifiable grouping of healthcare-related activities characterized by the entity relationship between the subject of care and a healthcare provider; such a grouping is determined by the healthcare provider. A patient encounter represents interaction between a healthcare provider and a patient with a face-to-face patient visit to a clinician's office, or any electronically remote interaction with a clinician for any form of diagnostic treatment or therapeutic event. Encounters can be billable events but are not limited to billable interactions. Each encounter has an associated location or modality within which it occurred (such as an office, home, electronic methods, phone encounter, or telemedicine methods). The encounter location attribute defines the patient's location at the time of measurement. Different levels and modes of interaction can be specified in the direct reference code or value set value associated with the element."
"Family History","Family History represents a diagnosis or problem experienced by a family member of the patient. Typically, a family history will not contain very much detail, but the simple identification of a diagnosis or problem in the patient's family history may be relevant to the care of the patient. If a relationship is specified, codes from the HL7 Personal Relationship Role Type value set (2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19563) should be used to ensure compatibility with Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA) reporting constraints."
"Immunization","Immunization represents vaccines administered to patients in healthcare settings, but does not include non-vaccine agents."
"Individual Characteristic","Individual Characteristic represents specific factors about a patient, clinician, provider, or facility. Included are demographics, behavioral factors, social or cultural factors, available resources, and preferences. Behaviors reference responses or actions that affect (either positively or negatively) health or healthcare. Included in this category are mental health issues, adherence issues unrelated to other factors or resources, coping ability, grief issues, and substance use/abuse. Social/cultural factors are characteristics of an individual related to family/caregiver support, education, and literacy (including health literacy), primary language, cultural beliefs (including health beliefs), persistent life stressors, spiritual and religious beliefs, immigration status, and history of abuse or neglect. Resources are means available to a patient to meet health and healthcare needs, which might include caregiver support, insurance coverage, financial resources, and community resources to which the patient is already connected and from which the patient is receiving benefit. Preferences are choices made by patients and their caregivers relative to options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information."
"Intervention","<p>Intervention represents a course of action intended to achieve a result in the care of persons with health problems that does not involve direct physical contact with a patient. Examples include patient education and therapeutic communication.</p><p>Note that while the QDM categories Intervention and Procedure are modeled identically and interoperability standards do not differentiate between them, both are retained in the QDM as they are more clinically expressive for clinicians to understand the measure intent.</p>"
"Laboratory Test","Laboratory Test represents a medical procedure that involves testing a sample of blood, urine, or other substance from the body. Tests can help determine a diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working, or monitor the disease over time. The QDM data category Laboratory Test is only used for information about the subject of record."
"Medication","Medication represents clinical drugs or chemical substances intended for use in the medical diagnosis, cure, treatment, or prevention of disease. Medications are defined as directly referenced values or value sets containing values derived from code systems such as RxNorm."
"Participation","Participation represents a patient's coverage by a program such as an insurance or medical plan or a payment agreement. Such programs can include patient-centered medical home, disease-specific programs, etc."
"Physical Exam","Physical Exam represents the evaluation of the patient's body and/or mental status to determine its state of health. The techniques of examination can include palpation (feeling with the hands or fingers), percussion (tapping with the fingers), auscultation (listening), visual inspection or observation, inquisition and smell. Measurements may include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration) as well as other clinical measures (such as expiratory flow rate and size of lesion). In the context of quality measurement, the physical exam category is also used to represent calculations based upon measurements (such as body mass index [BMI]). Physical exam includes psychiatric examinations."
"Procedure","Procedure is derived directly from HL7 and Canada Health Infoway: 'An Act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject. ...Procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions ... Procedure does not comprise all acts of <em>[sic]</em> whose intent is intervention or treatment.' A procedure may be a surgery or other type of physical manipulation of a person's body in whole or in part for purposes of making observations and diagnoses or providing treatment."
"Related Person","<p>A ""Related Person"" typically has a personal or non-healthcare-specific professional relationship to the patient. A ""Related Person"" QDM datatype is primarily used to reference another person involved with the patient""s care or as a source to gain information about the patient. Some individuals may serve as both an activity performer (i.e., referenced as the Care Partner entity), and a ""Related Person"" (i.e., the individual from whose record clinical information should be retrieved to support care provided to a patient). The QDM datatype, ""Related Person"", references the latter. <ul style=""list-style-type: ""- "";""><li>Example ""Related Persons"" are a patient""s mother, father, spouse, partner, relatives, friends, a neighbor bringing a patient to the hospital, or a patient""s attorney or guardian.</li></ul> An example to describe usage of the ""Related Person"" QDM datatype is to determine clinical information about a newborn infant""s mother. In this hypothetical example, a measure might want to evaluate gestational age at the time of birth. One method is to expect entry on the infant""s record of an observation question about gestational age at the time of birth requesting the estimated due date such that it can be compared with the actual birth date. That method uses the QDM datatype ""Assessment, Performed"" to request the estimated due date. However, to be able to directly reference the mother""s record for the estimated due date requires the QDM datatype ""Related Person"". This datatype enables authors to reference information from other data items as appropriate.</p><p>Specifically, for a ""Related Person"", the eCQM should be tested to determine if the index patient""s record can access information from the record of the expected related person. Some feedback suggests that a patient""s record may have a link to another inpatient record (e.g., an infant""s chart might have a link to the mother""s chart), but it is not clear that codified information from the related person can be accessed. In previous versions of QDM, such information had to be referenced as an observation related to the patient that is the subject of the measure ""Assessment, Performed"" is used to reference such an observation and QDM 5.5 retains that same capability.</p>"
"Substance","<p>Substance represents a homogeneous material with definite composition that includes allergens, biological materials, chemicals, foods, drugs, and materials. QDM distinguishes between medications from non-medication substances by separately listing medication datatypes. Substance may or may not have a code or be classified by a code system such RxNorm. Examples of a substance may include environmental agents (e.g., pollen, dust) and food (e.g., vitamins).</p><p>Measure developers have considered the use of the QDM substance category in light of alignment with existing interoperability data standards. Two use cases require further investigation and effort in the HL7 FHIR realm:</p><p><strong>Nutrition [Considerations for Future Use]</strong><br/>The nutrition mappings from QDM to FHIR resources require continued effort as of the printing of this QDM 5.5 version. The FHIR NutritionOrder Resource is a record of the request for the supply of a diet, oral supplement or enteral formulas for a patient, and thus allow specification of a complete diet order, but not an order for an individual nutrient. The NutritionOrder resource is currently at a low maturity level (i.e., it has had limited testing). Therefore, for the current QDM 5.5 reference, substance is modeled similarly to medications.</p><p><strong>Blood Products [Considerations for Future Use]</strong><br/> The HL7 FHIR version 4.0 resource for blood products allow specification of the blood product as a biologically derived product, but specification for how such products are administered remains in development. Therefore, for the current QDM 5.5 reference, blood product administration can be managed using QDM datatypes “Procedure, Performed” or “Substance, Administered” based on measure developer findings during measure implementation testing.</p>"
"Symptom","Symptom represents an indication that a person has a condition or disease. Some examples are headache, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and pain. Also, symptoms are subjective manifestations of the disease perceived by the patient. As an example to differentiate symptom from finding, the patient's subjective symptom of fever is distinguished from the temperature (a finding). A finding could reference a temperature-measuring device and a recorder. The recorder could be the device (with electronic data capture) or an individual (healthcare provider, patient, etc.). Note that while many symptoms are entered as findings as part of assessments and, therefore, may not be included in a specific EHR ""symptom"" section, QDM 5.5 retains the QDM datatype, ""Symptom"", for clarity of expression in the human readable eCQM."
"Entities","There are four QDM entities including definitions, attributes, type of information used and cardinality. Cardinality refers to the number of instances of the attribute that can be included in the measure description or the performance report (e.g., only once, or multiple times). Note that cardinality for Entity attributes is 0..1 (i.e., not required to be present and can occur up to 1 time)."
