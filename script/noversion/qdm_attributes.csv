title,description
Active dateTime,"When the order indicates the first immunization administration should occur. active dateTime is most often used to specify immunizations for which administration is intended at a specific time in the future. If active dateTime is not specified, it defaults to the author dateTime (when signed)."
Admission Source,"The location from which the patient was admitted (e.g., physician referral, facility from which the patient was transferred)."
Anatomical Approach Site,"The anatomical site or structure through which the action represented by the datatype reaches, or should reach, its target."
Anatomical Location Site,"The anatomical site or structure<ul><li>Where the diagnosis/problem manifests itself (a).</li><li>That is the focus of the action represented by the datatype (b).</li></ul>"
Author dateTime,"<p>The time the data element was entered into the clinical software. Note, some datatypes include both relevant dateTime and author dateTime attributes. When both are present, author dateTime is included to accommodate negation rationale.</p> <p>The author dateTime addresses when an activity is documented. Documentation can occur at the beginning, during, at the end, or subsequent to the end of the activity. The author dateTime should be used only if the relevantPeriod cannot be obtained or to represent the time negation rationale is documented.</p><p>Note: negation rationale indicates a one-time documentation of a reason an activity is not performed. Negation of QDM datatype related actions for a reason always use the author dateTime attribute to reference timing and must not use relevantPeriod.</p>"
Birth dateTime,"The date and time that the patient was born."
Components,"Elements included or documented as part of evaluations or test panels.<ul><li>Examples include: specific questions included in assesments, tests included in a laboratory test panel, observations included in a cardiac exam during a physical examination. Each assessment, diagnostic study, laboratory test, physical exam, or procedure may have one or more components.</li></ul>components also reference specific details about an encounter diagnosis.<ul><li>Examples include an ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis that is also present on admission and refers to the principal diagnosis (rank = 1)</li</ul>"
Category,"The type of message conveyed by a communication (e.g., notification, alert, reminder, instruction)."
Cause,"<p>The recorded cause of death.</p> <p>Note: Previous versions of the QDM referred to this attribute as reason.</p>"
Code,"The single code or a member of the value set used to represent the quality data element. The code attribute explicitly specifies the value set (or direct reference code) filter such that the query will retrieve only values defined by the QDM data element value or value set. Previous versions of QDM datatypes implicitly refer to attributes about a set of items that are included in a value set.<ul><li>All QDM data elements require a QDM datatype with either a value set or direct reference code to specify the data element and a code is required.</li><li>If the QDM data element's attribute specifies a value set or direct reference code, the code attribute is required.</li><li>If the QDM data element's attribute does not specify a value set or direct reference code, the code attribute is not required.</li></ul>Earlier versions did not explicitly state that the datatype attributes only refer to a specific item that is a member of the defined value set. The code is applied in the CQL Model Info used to translate the CQL into the Expression Logical Model (ELM) to enhance computer readability. Measure developers do not need to specify any additional code."
Expiration dateTime,"The date and time that the patient passed away."
Days supplied,"Amount of medication expressed as a timing amount, i.e., the number of days over which the medication is expected to last."
Diagnoses,"<p>Coded diagnoses/problems addressed during the encounter. The diagnoses attribute has three components:</p><ul><li>diagnosis (code)</li><li>presentOnAdmissionIndicator (code)</li><li>rank (positive integer)</li></ul><p>To reference an encounter diagnosis, the expression must include the diagnosis code component. The other components are optional. The expression should only include the presentOnAdmissionIndicator if it is necessary to reference present on admission and should only include the rank if it is necessary to reference principal diagnosis.</p><p>The ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis attribute is intended to capture ALL diagnoses, including the principal diagnosis, i.e., all diagnoses addressed during the encounter represented by the diagnosis (code) used in the expression.The presentOnAdmissionIndicator (code) allows the eCQM developer to include criteria about whether each specific ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis was present at the time of admission (an indicator used to evaluate patient safety and adverse events). See presentOnAdmissionIndicator attribute definition for information about using the ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis attribute.</p><p>The ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis (rank) replaces the principal diagnosis attribute. To reference a principal diagnosis, eCQM developers should express the ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis with a diagnosis (code) and a rank of 1. See definition of rank attribute.</p><p>With an ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis, there is no dependency on the timing of the diagnosis in relation to the encounter.</p><ul style=""list-style-type: '- ';""><li>Use of the ""Encounter, Performed"": diagnoses attribute component and the ""Diagnosis"" datatype is redundant for relating the diagnosis to the ""Encounter, Performed"". The ""Encounter, Performed"": diagnoses component syntax is preferred.</li><li>Referencing the same diagnosis using ""Encounter, Performed"" (diagnoses attribute) and ""Diagnosis"" (datatype) should only occur if the measure must define a specified length of a prevalencePeriod, e.g.,<ul><li>The measure must assure that the diagnoses<ul style=""list-style-type: '- ';""><li>have been present for at least some defined time period before the encounter, and</li><li>were addressed during the ""Encounter, Performed""</li></ul></li></ul></li><ul>"
Discharge Disposition,"The disposition, or location to which the patient is transferred at the time of hospital discharge."
Dispenser,"<p>The individual performing the dispense.</p><p>The dispenser attribute references the new QDM entities (Patient, Care Partner, Practitioner, or Organization) and any or all of the attributes of the respective QDM entity. For example, a measure developer seeking to assure the dispensing pharmacy is part of the same organization as the prescribing physician can specify that both the ""Medication, Order"" prescriber and dispenser and specify the same QDM entity = organization identifer for each.</p>"
Dosage,"Details of how <em>much</em> medication is taken or is to be taken, i.e., the quantity (mg, cc, tablets) to be taken at a single administration."
Expiration dateTime,"The date and time that the patient passed away."
Expired dateTime,"The date and time that the patient passed away."
Facility Location,"The particular locations in a facility in which the diagnostic study or encounter occurs or occurred. Examples include intensive care units (ICUs), nonICUs, burn critical care unit, neonatal ICU, and respiratory care unit. Each ""Encounter, Performed"" may have one or more locations. For example, a patient treated in multiple locations during an individual encounter might be expressed as:<ul><li>""Encounter, Performed"": Inpatient Admission, facility locations<ul><li>ICU (locationPeriod)</li><li>Non-ICU Admission (locationPeriod)</li><li>Rehab (locationPeriod)</li></ul></li></ul>"
Facility Locations,"The particular locations in a facility in which the diagnostic study or encounter occurs or occurred. Examples include intensive care units (ICUs), nonICUs, burn critical care unit, neonatal ICU, and respiratory care unit. Each ""Encounter, Performed"" may have one or more locations. For example, a patient treated in multiple locations during an individual encounter might be expressed as:<ul><li>""Encounter, Performed"": Inpatient Admission, facility locations<ul><li>ICU (locationPeriod)</li><li>Non-ICU Admission (locationPeriod)</li><li>Rehab (locationPeriod)</li></ul></li></ul>"
Frequency,"Indicates how frequently the medication or substance:<ul><li>Is administered to a patient for an active medication (a).</li><li>Was administered to the patient (b).</li><li>Should be taken by the patient or administered to the patient (c).</li><li>Is recommended to be given to the patient (d).</li></ul>"
ID,"The identifier of a specific instance of any QDM data element. CQL logic uses the id reference to specify that a query expects a specific instance of an element to be retrieved."
Identifier,"External identifiers for the QDM Entity (Patient, Care Partner, Practitioner or Organization) and the QDM datatype ""Related Person"". Unless specified in program or measure-specific guidance, eCQMs generally allow implementers to use local identifiers for such individuals or organizations. Program or measure-specific guidance may specify a required identification system (e.g., National Provider Identifier [NPI] for practitioners, or CMS Certification Number [CCN] for hospitals)."
Incision dateTime,"The date and time of the first incision of the procedure. Incision dateTime is a single point in time available from the Operating Room and/or Anesthesia Record."
Length of Stay,"The difference of the admission date/time and the discharge date/time for the encounter. This attribute should not be used for outpatient encounters."
LinkedPatientId,"The instance identity for a specific Patient instance that is the Patient record for this Related Person. CQL logic uses the linkedPatientId to establish the context identity when expressing a query to a related patient context."
LocationPeriod,"The time the patient arrived at the location to the time the patient departed from the location. Each ""Encounter, Performed"" may have one or more facility locations. For example, a patient treated in multiple facility locations during an individual encounter might be expressed as:<ul><li>""Encounter, Performed"": Inpatient Admission facility locations<ul><li>ICU (locationPeriod)</li><li>Non-ICU Admission (locationPeriod)</li><li>Rehab (locationPeriod)</li></ul></li></ul>locationPeriod is used with a code for the location. The pair of code and locationPeriod is associated with each item in the facility locations list attribute."
Medium,"A channel used for a communication (e.g., fax, email, etc.)"
Method,"Indicates the procedure or technique used in its performance."
Negation Rationale,"<p>Indicates the reason that an action was not performed. Only QDM datatypes that represent actions (e.g., performed, recommended, communication, order, dispensed) allow the negation rationale attribute. The intent is to indicate a justification that such action did not happen as expected. This attribute specifically does not address the presence or absence of information in a clinical record (e.g., documented absence of allergies versus lack of documentation about allergies). QDM assumes a world view that absence of evidence indicates information does not exist or an action did not happen. To express such lack of evidence, an eCQM author should use the CQL expression not exists with reference to the data element rather than the QDM data model. negation rationale in QDM signifies only a reason for such absence, i.e., the reason must be present to qualify for negation rationale. The syntax in the human readable HQMF is addressed in CQL examples and in the MAT User Guide. Prior versions of QDM used the syntax, ""Procedure, Performed not done."" QDM versions starting with 5.3 use the syntax, ""Procedure, not Performed."" Section A-5 provides examples for expressing negation rationale in CQL.</p>Note: negation rationale indicates a one-time documentation of a reason an activity is not performed. Negation of QDM datatype-related actions for a reason always use the author dateTime attribute to reference timing and must not use relevantPeriod.</p>"
Ordinality,"Ordinality has been removed as an attribute in QDM version 5.5. Its only use had been to reference principal procedures. The attribute rank allows an integer indicating the order in a series in procedure-related QDM datatypes and in the ""Encounter, Performed"" diagnosis attribute as a component. rank = 1 refers to a principal diagnosis or a principal prcedure."
Participant,"participant references a practitioner or the organization taking part in an encounter. For the purpose of QDM, participant references the primary performer, i.e., restricted to the principal or primary participant in the encounter. The participant attribute references the new QDM entities (Patient, Care Partner, Practitioner, or Organization) and any or all the attributes of the respective QDM entity. For example, to reference that the physician who was the primary participant (performer) of an encounter, was also the requester of a ""Medication, Order"", and assure the physician's specialty meets the measures requirements the eCQM can use the Practitioner entity and its attributes. The eCQM could also reference a physician practice or a hospital as the participant and reference the Organization entity and indicate the identifier and/or the organization type."
Participation Period,"The time from:<ul><li>enrollmentStartdate - The time the patient enrolled in the program.</li></ul> to <ul><li>enrollmentEndDate - The time the patient's enrollement in the program ends.</li></ul><p>Note: participationPeriod references the QDM datatype ""Participation"", representing a patient's coverage by a program such as an insurance or medical plan or a payment agreement. The participationPeriod is not to be confused with the QDM participant attribute used with the ""Encounter, Performed"" QDM datatype.</p>"
Performer,"The performer is the person or organization that is responsible for the action (e.g., the individual or organization carrying out the activity). The performer references a QDM entity and any or all of the attributes of the selected QDM entity. For example, to reference that a physician who performed a procedure is the same person who was the primary participant in an Encounter and assure the physician's specialty meets the measure's requirements, the eCQM can reference the Practitioner entity and its attributes. Should the eCQM choose to reference a physician practice or a hospital, the performer can reference the Organization entity and indicate the identifier and/or the organization type."
Prescriber,"<p>The person who ordered the prescription.</p><p>The prescriber attribute references the new QDM entities (patient, care partner, practitioner, or organization) and any or all of the attributes of the respective QDM entity. For example, to reference that a physician who prescribed a medication is the same person who was the primary participant in an Encounter and assure the physician's specialty meets the measures requirements, the eCQM can use the Practitioner Entity and its attributes.</p><p> Should the eCQM choose to reference a physician practice or a  hospital, the performer can reference the Organization Entity and indicate the identifier and/or the organization type.</p><p>The CQL can specify which identifier the measure expects to be used (e.g., National Provider Identifier or Tax Identifier Number) or it can avoid referencing an identifier to allow the implementing organization or practice to use its own identifier.</p>"
Present on Admission Indicator,"The Diagnosis Present on Admission (POA) is an indicator assigned to Inpatient Encounter diagnoses and is used in quality and patient safety measures. QDM references this indicator as a component of each Encounter, Performed diagnosis attribute. At the time of publication of QDM 5.5, two LOINC concepts reference this item: 89251-3 (condition present on admission - used in the wound assessment model), and 78026-2 (diagnosis present on admission - used in consolidated Clinical Document Architecture - CCDA). The full set of allowable values in the UB-0423 standard include:<ul><li><strong>Y</strong> - Diagnosis was present at the time of admission</li><li><strong>N</strong> - Diagnosis was not present at the time of admission</li><li><strong>U</strong> - Documentation insufficient to determine if condition was present at the time of inpatient admission</li><li><strong>W</strong> - Clinically undetermined. Provider unable to clinically determine whether the condition was present at the time of inpatient admission</li><li><strong>1</strong> - Unreported/not used (exempt from POA reporting – equivalent to a blank on the UB04 form)</li></ul>"
Prevalence Period,"Prevalance Period is the time from onset dateTime to abatement dateTime."
Priority,"priority indicates the urgency of the procedure or the encounter referenced. In eCQMs the priority attribute will help specify elective from urgent encounters (e.g., hospital admissions) or procedures. priority is a codable concept (i.e., may use a direct reference code or a value set). For example, priority is used to express an elective procedure or encounter from an emergency procedure or encounter.)"
Rank,"<p>Rank defines a position in a hierarchy for diagnoses or procedures. It replaces ordinality previously assigned to ""Procedure, Performed"", ""Procedure, Order"", and ""Procedure, Recommended"". ordinality does not align with any FHIR resources; it does align with definitions for FHIR encounter.diagnosis. Thus, the concept fits best consistently across QDM for the concept of principal for encounter diagnosis and for procedure.</p><p>The thought process or justification for the datatype. In some measures, specific treatments are acceptable inclusion criteria only if a justified reason is present. Each of these measures uses a value set (often, but not exclusively, using SNOMED CT) to express acceptable justification reasons. Other measures specify reasons as justification for exclusions. Examples include patient, system, or medical-related reasons for declining to perform specific actions. Each of these measures also uses a value set to express acceptable justification reasons for declining to perform expected actions.</p>"
Reason,"The thought process or justification for the datatype. In some measures, specific treatments are acceptable inclusion criteria only if a justified reason is present. Each of these measures uses a value set (often, but not exclusively, using SNOMED CT) to express acceptable justification reasons. Other measures specify reasons as justification for exclusions. Examples include patient, system, or medical-related reasons for declining to perform specific actions. Each of these measures also uses a value set to express acceptable justification reasons for declining to perform expected actions."
Received dateTime,"The time a communication was received."
Recipient,"<p>The entity (e.g., person, organization, clinical information system, or device) which is the target of a communication.</p><p> The recipient attribute references the new QDM entities (Patient, Care Partner, Practitioner, or Organization) and any or all of the attributes of the respective QDM entity.</p>"
Recorder,"<p>The recorder indicates who recorded (or documented) the information (e.g., the individual or organization documenting the information). Note that HL7 FHIR modeling includes reference to asserter for concepts such as diagnosis and Allergy/Intolerance. Feedback from implementers and EHR vendors suggest that asserter fields default to the individual entering the information without clear evidence about how often clinicians change the default to theperson who reported the information. Therefore, QDM retains a recorder attribute for the referenced QDM datatypes.</p><p>The prescriber attribute references the new QDM entities (patient, care partner, practitioner, or organization) and any or all of the attributes of the respective QDM entity. For example, to reference that a physician who recorded a diagnosis is the same person who was the primary participant in an Encounter and assure the physician's specialty meets the measures requirements, the eCQM can use the Practitioner Entity and its attributes. Should the eCQM choose to reference a physician practice or a hospital, the performer can reference the Organization Entity and indicate the identifier and/or the organization type.</p>"
Reference Range High,"The high bound (inclusive) of values that are considered normal."
Reference Range Low,"The low bound (inclusive) of values that are considered normal."
Refills,"The number of refills allowed by the prescription."
relatedTo,"An attribute that indicates one QDM data element fulfills the expecations of another QDM data element."
Relationship,"The relationship of the family member to the patient. To ensure compatibility with QRDA reporting constraints, relationship codes should come from the HL7 Personal Relationship Role Type value set (2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19563)."
Relevant dateTime,"Relevant dateTime addresses the time an activity occurs as a single point in time. If the activity occurs over a period of time, use Relevant Period."
Relevant Period,"<p>Relevant Period addresses the time between the start of an action to the end of an action. Each datatype using relevant period defines specific definitions for the start and stop time for the action listed.</p><p>Note: negation rationale indicates a one-time documentation of a reason an activity is not performed. Negation of QDM datatyperelated actions for a reason always use the author dateTime attribute to reference timing and must not use relevantPeriod</p>"
Requester,"The requester is who or what is requesting service (e.g., the individual or organization asking for the service to be carried out). The requester attribute references the new QDM entities (Patient, Care Partner, Practitioner, or Organization) and any or all of the attributes of the respective QDM entity. For example, to reference that a physician who requested a procedure is the same person who was the primary participant in an ""Encounter, Performed"" and assure the physician's specialty meets the measures requirements, the eCQM can use the Practitioner Entity and its attributes. Should the eCQM choose to reference a physician practice or a hospital, the performer can reference the Organization Entity and indicate the identifier and/or the organization type."
Result,"<p>The final consequences or data collected from the datatype. results can be used in four ways to express:</p><ul><li>That a result is present in the electronic record but any entry is acceptable</li><li>A numerical result is reported directly as a value. Values may be integers or decimal numbers without units, or as a quantity with a value and units - examples:<ul><li>100mg/dL for a lab test</li><li>140 mmHg for blood pressure</li><li>as a percentage (actually as a quantity with % as units)</li><li>as a titer or ratio (e.g., 1:4, 1:80)</li></ul></li><li>A result that matches one of a specific set of coded concepts in a value set or a code that matches a direct reference code</li><li>A result as a dateTime (""Assessment, Performed"" and components)</li></ul>"
Result dateTime,"<p>The date and time this version of the observation was made available to providers, typically after the results have been reviewed and verified.</p><p>In the original QDM 5.5 publication, result dateTime stated: the time the result report is generated and saved in the database.</p>"
Route,"Refers to the path by which the medication or substance should be taken into the body system, such as intradermally, intrathecally, intramuscularly, intranasally, intravenously, orally, rectally, subcutaneously, sublingually, topically, or vaginally."
Sender,"<p>The entity (e.g., person, organization, clinical information system, or device) that is the source of a communication.</p><p>The sender attribute references the new QDM entities (Patient, Care Partner, Practitioner, or Organization) and any or all of the attributes of the respective QDM entity.</p>"
Sent dateTime,"The time a communication was sent"
Setting,"Where the medication is expected to be consumed or administered. Examples:<ul><li>Inpatient - in the hospital during the current inpatient stay</li><li>Outpatient - in an outpatient facility such as an ambulatory surgical center</li><li>Community - in the ambulatory setting (e.g., at home)</li></ul>"
Severity,"Indicates the intensity of the specified datatype (e.g., persistent, moderate, or severe)."
Status,"Indicates the particular stage of the action represented by the datatype."
Status date,"The date a 'care goal' was updated and/or changed status."
Supply,"<p>The quantity (amount) of therapeutic agent that was provided to a patient (i.e., number of doses, number of tablets or pills, volume of medication) indicated to be given during a procedure, diagnostic test, or medication, or substance administration.</p><p>Note: Prior versions of the QDM (4.3 and earlier) addressed dose with two potential interpretations - (1) the quantity to be taken or administered with each administration and (2) the quantity of medication supplied (i.e., number of doses). QDM 5.0 and subsequent versions clarify the difference by defining dosage and supply, respectively.</p><ul><li>""Medication, Discharge"" includes medications the provider has indicated the patient should take after dischange from the hospital. This medication list is part of the discharge instructions provided to a patient. The list may include medication supply if it incorporates medication orders written at discharge even though the supply will not be present for medications the patient already has at home or purchases over-the-counter (without a prescription).</li></ul>"
Target Outcome,"The expected outcome that will indicate the ""Care Goal"" is achieved or met. The target outcome can be expressed using a code, integer, decimal, quantity (value and units), or ratio."
Type,"The characterization of the reaction (e.g., hypersensitivity, rash, gastroenteric symptoms, etc.)."
