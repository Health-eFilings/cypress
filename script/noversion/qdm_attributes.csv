title,description
Active dateTime,"When the order indicates the first immunization administration should occur. Active dateTime is most often used to specify immunizations for which administration is intended at a specific time in the future. If Active dateTime is not specified, it defaults to the Author (signed) dateTime."
Admission Source,"The location from which the patient was admitted (e.g., physician referral, facility from which the patient was transferred)."
Anatomical Approach Site,"The anatomical site or structure through which the action represented by the datatype reaches, or should reach, its target."
Anatomical Location Site,"The anatomical site or structure where the diagnosis/problem manifests itself (a). The anatomical site or structure that is the focus of the action represented by the datatype (b)."
Author dateTime,"The time the data element was entered into the clinical software. Note, some datatypes include both Relevant Time and Author dateTime attributes. The purpose is to accommodate Author dateTime if the actual start and stop times are not available when evaluating for feasibility, and also to allow specification of a time for Negation Rationale."
Cause,"The recorded cause of death."
Code,"The single code or a member of the value set used to represent the quality data element. The code attribute explicitly specifies the value set (or direct referenced code) filter such that the query will retrieve only values defined by the QDM data element value or value set."
Birth dateTime,"The date and time that the patient was born."
Components,"Elements included or documented as part of evaluations or test panels. Examples include: specific questions included in assessments, tests included in a laboratory test panel, observations included in a cardiac exam during a physical examination. Each assessment, diagnostic study, laboratory test, physical exam or procedure may have one or more components."
Expiration dateTime,"The date and time that the patient passed away."
Diagnoses,"Coded diagnoses/problems addressed during the encounter. The diagnoses attribute is intended to capture ALL diagnoses, including principal diagnosis. Use of the Encounter, Performed: diagnoses attribute and the Diagnosis datatype is redundant for relating the diagnosis to the Encounter, Performed. The Encounter, Performed: diagnoses syntax is preferred. Referencing the same diagnosis using Encounter, Performed (diagnoses attribute) and Diagnosis (datatype) should only occur if the measure must define a specified length of a prevalence period, e.g., the measure must assure that the diagnoses have been present for at least some defined time period before the encounter, and were addressed during the Encounter."
Discharge Disposition,"The disposition or location to which the patient is transferred at the time of hospital discharge."
Dosage,"Details of how medication is taken or is to be taken, i.e., the quantity (mg, cc, tablets) to be taken at a single administration."
Facility Location,"The particular locations in a facility in which the diagnostic study or encounter occurs or occurred. Examples include, but are not limited to, intensive care units (ICUs), non- ICUs, burn critical-care unit, neonatal ICU, and respiratory-care unit. Each Encounter, Performed may have 1 or more locations. For example, a patient treated in multiple locations during an individual encounter might be expressed as: Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Admission, ICU (location period), Non-ICU Admission (location period), Rehab (location period). Facility Location (singular) is used for Adverse Event; Diagnostic Study, Performed; Encounter, Order; Encounter, Recommended."
Facility Locations,"The particular locations in a facility in which the diagnostic study or encounter occurs or occurred. Examples include, but are not limited to, intensive care units (ICUs), non- ICUs, burn critical-care unit, neonatal ICU, and respiratory-care unit. Each Encounter, Performed may have 1 or more locations. For example, a patient treated in multiple locations during an individual encounter might be expressed as: Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Admission, ICU (location period), Non-ICU Admission (location period), Rehab (location period). Facility Locations (plural) is used for Encounter, Performed since there may be more than one facility location used in any given encounter."
Frequency,"Indicates how frequently the medication or substance: is administered to a patient for an active medication (Medication, Active), was administered to the patient (Medication, Administered and Substance, Administered), should be taken by the patient or administered to the patient (Medication, Discharge; Medication, Dispensed; Medication, Order; and Substance, Order), is recommended to be given to the patient (Substance, Recommended)."
id,
Incision dateTime,"The date and time of the first incision of the procedure. Incision dateTime is a single point in time available from the Operating Room and/or Anesthesia Record."
Length of Stay,"The difference of the admission date/time and the discharge date/time for the encounter. This attribute should not be used for outpatient encounters."
Location Period,"The time the patient arrived at the location to the time the patient departed from the location. Each Encounter, Performed may have 1 or more locations"
Method,"Indicates the procedure or technique used in its performance."
Negation Rationale,"The QDM attribute, negation rationale indicates the reason that an action was not performed. Only QDM datatypes that represent actions (e.g., performed, recommended, communication, order, dispensed) allow the 'negation rationale' attribute. The intent is to indicate a justification that such action did not happen as expected. This attribute specifically does not address the presence or absence of information in a clinical record (e.g., documented absence of allergies versus lack of documentation about allergies). QDM assumes that any information expected will be in a clinical record. The situation is different when something that normally would be expected to be done is specifically not done because of a valid clinical reason (such as the patient is allergic, they are suffering from a complication, or some other rationale. In this case, the 'thing not done' is rarely documented, especially as a code, in the patient record. To express such lack of evidence, an eCQM author should use a CQL 'not exists' expression noted in the examples, and they must also capture the Negation rationale to capture a reason for the absence, i.e., the reason must be included to qualify as a negation rationale type expression. The syntax in the human readable HQMF is described in CQL examples and in the MAT User Guide. Prior versions of QDM used the syntax, 'Procedure, Performed not done.' QDM 5.5 uses the syntax, 'Procedure, not Performed' and this is then associated with either a DRC or a value set used to identify 'the expected thing,' that in this case was not done. Negation Rationale attribute value indicates a one-time documentation of a reason an activity is not performed. Negation of QDM datatype-related actions for a reason always use the author dateTime attribute to reference timing."
Ordinality,"The scale in which different procedures are ordered in terms of the qualitative value, as opposed to a ranking performed strictly numerically or quantitatively."
Participation Period,"The time from: enrollmentStartdate to enrollmentEndDate."
Prevalence Period,"Prevalance Period is the time from onset dateTime to abatement dateTime."
Principal Diagnosis,"The coded diagnosis/problem established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care."
Reason,"The thought process or justification for the datatype. In some measures, specific treatments are acceptable inclusion criteria only if a justified reason is present. Each of these measures uses a value set (often, but not exclusively, using SNOMED CT) to express acceptable justification reasons. Other measures specify reasons as justification for exclusions. Examples include patient, system, or medical-related reasons for declining to perform specific actions. Each of these measures also uses a value set to express acceptable justification reasons for declining to perform expected actions."
Reference Range,"The low and high bound (inclusive) of values that are considered normal."
Refills,"The number of refills allowed by the prescription."
relatedTo,"An attribute that indicates one QDM data element fulfills the expecations of another QDM data element."
Relationships,"The relationship of the family member to the patient. To ensure compatibility with QRDA reporting constraints, relationship codes should come from the HL7 Personal Relationship Role Type value set (2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19563)."
Relevant Period,"Relevant Period addresses the time between the start of an action to the end of an action. Each datatype using relevant period defines specific definitions for the start and stop time for the action listed."
Result,"The final consequences or data collected from the datatype. Results can be used in four ways, to express: (1) That a result is present in the electronic record but any entry is acceptable. (2) A numerical result is reported directly as a value. Values may be integers or decimal numbers without units, or as a quantity with a value and units. Examples: 100 mg/dL for a lab test, 140 mmHg for blood pressure, as a percentage (actually a quantity with % as units), as a ratio (e.g., 1:4, 1:80). (3) A result that matches one of a specific set of coded concepts in a value set or a code that matches a direct reference code. (4) A result as a dateTime (Assessment, Performed and components). Note: Measures use Clinical Quality Language (CQL) logic to express the mathematical operators to constrain desired results to those above or below a certain threshold."
Result dateTime,"The time the result report is generated and saved in the database."
Route,"Refers to the path by which the medication or substance should be taken into the body system, such as intradermally, intrathecally, intramuscularly, intranasally, intravenously, orally, rectally, subcutaneously, sublingually, topically, or vaginally."
Severity,"Indicates the intensity of the specified datatype (e.g., persistent, moderate, or severe)."
Status,"Indicates the particular stage of the action represented by the datatype."
Supply,"The quantity (amount) of therapeutic agent that was provided to a patient (i.e., number of doses, number of tablets or pills, volume of medication). Indicated to be given during a procedure, diagnostic test, or medication or substance administration. Note: Prior versions of the QDM (4.3 and earlier) addressed 'dose' with two potential interpretations â€“ (1) the quantity to be taken or administered with each administration and (2) the quantity of medication supplied (i.e., number of doses). QDM 5.0 and subsequent versions clarify the difference by defining 'dosage' and 'supply,' respectively. Note: Medication, Discharge includes medications the provider has indicated the patient should take after dischange from the hospital. This medication list is part of the discharge instructions provided to a patient. The list may include medication supply if it incorporates medication orders written at discharge even though the supply will not be present for medications the patient already has at home or purchases over- the-counter (without a prescription)."
Target Outcome,"The expected outcome that will indicate the care goal is achieved, or met. The outcome can be expressed using a code, integer, decimal, quantity (value and units), or ratio."
Type,"The characterization of the reaction (e.g., hypersensitivity, rash, gastroenteric symptoms, etc.)."
